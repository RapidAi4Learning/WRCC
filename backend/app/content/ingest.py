"""Upload ingest — the only place a caller's bytes become bytes we store (D10).

Nothing that arrives here is stored as it arrived. Every accepted upload is
decoded to raw pixels and re-encoded, which settles three separate problems at
once and is the entire justification for the cost:

*Privacy.* A phone photo carries GPS coordinates in EXIF, and these bytes are
served from an endpoint that has no session (Instagram fetches images itself).
Re-encoding from pixel data leaves no metadata to leak.

*Size.* Assets live in a ``LargeBinary`` column. A 24 MP upload is ~8 MB in the
database; the same picture at 2048px is ~400 KB and is larger than any network
will display.

*Trust.* The declared content type and the filename extension are claims made
by the caller. Format is decided here by decoding the header, and a file that
is both a valid image and something else cannot survive being re-encoded.

Pure functions — no ORM, no I/O beyond PIL. The service in ``media.py`` owns
the database and the per-group rules.
